# Web Technologies Practical

This project is part of the Web Technologies Practical, where we explore the use of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **JSON** to create a fully functional webpage. The focus is on integrating these technologies to develop an interactive, user-friendly, and dynamic web application.

Our goal is to apply these technologies effectively while adhering to modern web development practices. This project showcases the skills learned in this course through the creation of a Pokémon-themed webshop called the Pokémon Webshop (Pokémart).
